```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)
source(here("all_custom_functions.R"))
```

```{r data}
cincy <- read_csv(here("data", "cincy.csv")) |>
  clean_names()
```

## Discriminant and Classification Analysis

### Correlated Quantitative Variables

```{r}
kable(cor(cincy |> select(-pricerank)))
```

```{r}
plot(cincy[,2:7])
```

It appears that quality and area, along with bathroom and area have the highest correlations. These may be omitted from analysis.

<!-- Flagged by Jett. Above needs better justification and should also cite the correlations -->

### Discriminant Analysis

```{r}
discrim(cincy[,-1], cincy[,1])
```

### Classification Analysis
